# Redesign Theory:

The "Just Basic!" redesign sports a fun and fresh logo inspired by classic Linux logos. It cleverly merges the letters "m" and "l" in a rounded square, symbolizing unity in the open-source community. The playful dot at the end of "ml." nods to dotfiles, adding a quirky touch. With its vibrant turquoise background, this logo is not just eye-catching but also feels right at home in the tech world!
